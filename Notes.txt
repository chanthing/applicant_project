Notes on Implementation of Customer Paradigm applicant project.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------


Assumptions:

Every object that inherits from AbstractModel will use the same database server, database, and
login credentials.

Namespaces are not used in order to keep things simple and not have to significantly
rework the project directory structure.

The procedural interface of mysqli is used, rather than the OO interface, in the interest of
minimizing dependence on a particular database server. PDO would be a further step in that
direction.


Explanations:

The properties _pk and _table were moved down into the superclass, AbstractModel because
they are needed to construct the required SQL statements.


Questions:

What version of PHP should I assume?

Why don't existing source files have /> closing tag (for the opening <?PHP) ?

Is the convention at Customer Paradigm to use false or NULL for no value?
